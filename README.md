Wine Origins: Leveraging Data Science and Machine Learning for Effective Analysis" Understanding the origin of wines is crucial for maintaining quality control and protecting brand reputation. This study aims to develop an application that utilizes machine learning techniques to gain insights into the origin of wines based on their chemical composition. The proposed document outlines the steps involved in the development and reflection phase of the project. The problem at hand is the subjective and time-consuming process of determining the provenance of wines. The clear problem definition is to create a machine learning model that accurately predicts the origin of wines using their chemical makeup. The concept involves evaluating the chemical composition of wines and employing machine learning algorithms to predict their origin. Data collection and preprocessing involve gathering data on the chemical makeup of wines from different regions and preparing a dataset for analysis. Feature engineering aims to identify the most relevant chemical or physical features for determining wine provenance. Multiple machine learning models, including random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks, are evaluated and compared for their predictive performance. In this study, the accuracy scores of the Logistic Regression and SVM models are compared. The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy score of approximately 97% after training and testing the dataset with a split of 80% for training and 20% for testing. In contrast, the SVM model achieved an accuracy score of around 76% with a split of 70% for training and 30% for testing. Based on the comparison, logistic regression outperformed SVM in terms of accuracy, making it a more suitable model for this dataset in performing chemical analysis using machine learning approaches. This quantitative evaluation allows researchers to choose the most appropriate model for the given dataset. The findings highlight the effectiveness of logistic regression in chemical analysis tasks utilizing machine learning and its potential for wine analysis applications
